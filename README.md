# HDI-Democracy-Regression-Analysis

#Second-level headingProject Overview

This project employs Multiple Linear Regressionto analyze the association between a country's Liberal Democracy Index (V-Dem) and its Human Development Index (HDI) for the year 2023. The analysis specifically isolates the net effect of democratization by controlling for key confounding variables, including Income Inequality (Gini Index), Health Outcomes (Infant Mortality Rate), Urbanization, and Government Effectiveness. All statistical procedures utilize R and robust standard errors (HC3) to address potential heteroskedasticity in the cross-sectional data.
